# JMath - Linear Algebra Math Library

## TLDR;
C++ linear algebra math library made for first year course work.

## Credits
Programmer / Designer - **Jeffrey M Johnson**

## What
Math library written in C++ compiled into both static and dynamic x86 library files as well as 
unit tests.

## How
#### Tools / Libraries
* C++
* GoogleTest

#### Interesting Code
* [Vector3 Class](https://github.com/JeffreyMJohnson/JMath/blob/dev/JMath_library/JMath_static/source/Vector3.cpp)
* [Matrix4 Class](https://github.com/JeffreyMJohnson/JMath/blob/dev/JMath_library/JMath_static/source/Matrix4.cpp)

## Current Status
Libraries build but the unit tests were written using google test framework as the visual studio tools
were rather lack-luster at the time of being written.  first year project and could use some
love. No need as there is a plethora of good libraries freely available now, but a polish would
be nice.

## To-Do
* Convert unit tests to use visual studio framework.
